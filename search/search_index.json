Permissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action. By assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs. \u963f\u62c9\u8d21\u7f51\u7edc Ensuring the success of decentralized organizations \u786e\u4fdd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u6210\u679c \u5c06\u6743\u529b\u4ea4\u56de\u5230\u7528\u6237\u624b\u4e0a The Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users.

Our mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity. ARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS Join us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard Aragon Governance Proposals is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon. Everyone is welcome to join in and aid in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see. Why Aragon? Aragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives. Organizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products. Their ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run. \u613f\u666f Evolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other We believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution. Experimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops. \u793e\u533a Aragon Chat - https://aragon.chat Aragon Research Forum - https://research.aragon.org Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/aragonproject LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/aragonproject/ YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/c/AragonProject Teams To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Association to form a company of core developers. Everyone currently employed by the Association will become employees of a new company funded by the Association. That way, we level the playing field for other teams to join the core development of the project . With Aragon Nest we are already supporting projects that are not necessarily sustainable by themselves yet, but are crucial to the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems. We will expand the scope of Nest to start funding alternative teams that have a desire to work on the Aragon client , aragonOS and on Aragon Apps . Since we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper , we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development . For more context, we've published three blog posts about why it makes sense to decentralize Aragon's development , the steps forward for the non-profit entity and onboarding new teams along with the Aragon Manifesto . Aragon One Aragon One is one of the development teams working on Aragon. Aragon One is a company that encompasses the foundational team working on the Aragon Project . The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible. We want Aragon One to be a small team, with high-bandwidth and trust between individuals. Keeping the team small will help us prevent many of the problems that arise when growing too much and too fast. Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well. CEO / Chief Executive Officer : Luis Cuende Luis has been awarded as the best underage European programmer in 2011, is a Forbes 30 Under 30 , a MIT TR35 and was an Advisor to the VP of the European Commission. He cofounded the blockchain startup Stampery . Prior to founding startups, he created the world's first Linux distribution with facelogin. Advisor to a few crypto projects that awake his curiosity. CTO / Chief Technical Officer : Jorge Izquierdo Curious hacker, creator of multiple apps for iOS and macOS. Reached App Store's #2. Always tinkering with new tech. Named as a 2017 class of Thiel Fellows . Already convinced about the decentralized future of the Internet, he has been building toy projects such as a mesh network or a small blockchain implementation since 2014.

The second team that will be working on the Aragon stack is a community focused effort led by the Giveth community : the Aragon DAC will kick off with two specific projects or 'Campaigns' : one focusing purely on development, the other on experimentation with the Aragon stack. Experienced members of Giveth and Aragon One will help kickstart the Aragon DAC initiatives on a voluntary and part-time basis, with the clear goal of steering the DAC towards full independence. Funding for the community will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to Aragon One and future teams that will be working on the project as well. The Development Campaign The Development Campaign is staffed with full-time and part-time people that create and tackle issues in the full Aragon Stack and is managed in a semi-decentralized way, while collaborating heavily with the Aragon One team and the R D Campaign. This Campaign is spearheaded by Quazia, Social Coding Circle Lead at Giveth The Community R D Campaign The Community R D Campaign will focus on helping end users (=non-developers) experiment with using the Aragon Stack. #Dogfooding is the name of the game!
