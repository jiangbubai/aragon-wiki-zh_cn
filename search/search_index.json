dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all of Aragon project's spaces, including the Aragon app, Rocket Chat, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and all other spaces associated with the Aragon project, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Aragon team. Some of Aragon project's spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. Our Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: Using welcoming and inclusive language Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences Gracefully accepting constructive criticism Focusing on what is best for the community Showing empathy towards other community members Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Impersonating an Aragon team member Organizing and participating in \"pump and dump\" campaigns for ANT or other assets Sharing links to illegal websites, such as phishing, malware, online gambling, or nonconsensual imagery Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \" hug \" or \" backrub \") without consent or after a request to stop Threats of violence Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm Deliberate intimidation Stalking or following Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes Sustained disruption of discussion Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease Deliberate \"outing\" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse Publication of non-harassing private communication Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting Aragon team prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. Aragon team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding: 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia' Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as \"leave me alone,\" \"go away,\" or \"I'm not discussing this with you\" Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions Our Responsibilities Aragon team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Aragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Aragon Chat admins @light or @tatu at Aragon Chat . If the person who is harassing you is one of these admins, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible. This code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community. In order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. Scope This Code of Conduct applies both within the Aragon project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include presenting themselves as Aragon community members, promoting the Aragon project as well as using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team. Enforcement Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Aragon projects team at Aragon Chat . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Aragon team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Aragon community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Aragon team. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Aragon response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Aragon project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Aragon community members or the general public.

It implements features like a token manager, a voting app, a finance app, a vault, and a very flexible permission system based off aragonOS . Aragon organizations are easily customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party apps. Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide services like a decentralized court arbitration system for them. For more information, please refer to our website our dapp white paper and our Network whitepaper . This document describes the plans to develop the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network.\u2029 History Vision Luis and Jorge have been dreaming of a decentralized world for years. They met via Twitter when they were only 15 years old, and immediately started building products together. At the age of 17, they prototyped a fully decentralized Internet replacement by using mesh networks, blockchain technology and protocols like Bluetooth LE and WiFi Direct. Stampery \u2014Luis\u2019 latest company\u2014made blockchain timestamping accessible, and has worked with institutions like the Estonian government, Microsoft and Telefonica. It participated in TechCrunch Disrupt and was backed by billionaire Tim Draper. Luis has also been recognized as a 30 Under 30 by Forbes and Innovator Under 35 by the MIT . Before building Aragon, Luis and Jorge were in Silicon Valley working on solving the problem of patent trolls with Unpatent. After figuring out how broken the underlying infrastructure of innovation is\u2014patent trolls thriving, Donald Trump winning the elections, bureaucracy eating entrepreneurship\u2014they decided to focus all of their time in building the infrastructure that new companies and organizations will run on top of.\u2029 When talking about Aragon, taking a step back and thinking about the why of organizational structures like companies is a sane move. Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services. However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks. Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures. Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The Nature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm . Both explore the concept of companies. At Aragon, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes. However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes. We want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread. And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points. Organizational Structure Aragon Community , defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network and the Aragon Network Token holders. Aragon Association , from now on, the Association , a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, will serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for future cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the Association consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Association will focus on overarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to- day work. The Association will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will be transferred to the ANT holders. Aragon One AG , a Swiss for-profit corporation that serves the Association and employs the first team that will work on the Aragon platform and the Aragon Network. Development Milestones We will divide development milestones in the form of releases. Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage\u2014running on the test network\u2014to begin in the production stage\u2014running on the main network\u2014going through multiple testing, security and QA stages. 0.1 \u2014 The Initial Release This the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted community testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to operate. It was not made public. Release Calendar Private Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.2 \u2014 The Public Release This was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows. Introduced a new UI styling and Kovan testnet support. For more information, read the launch post . Release Calendar Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.3 \u2014 The Governance Release This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any ERC20 token as a governance token\u2014ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation\u2014stepping stone for more dynamic bylaws. It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes. It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc. Release Calendar Alpha : April 2017 Release link 0.4 \u2014 The Bridge Release This release will focus on adding: Economic abstraction Companies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token Improved budgeting and accounting Organizations will be in itself the organization's bank account . Dividends Dividend sharing with shareholders, if desired. Fundraising tokens Company will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More flexible founding routes. Funds vault Final funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while maintaining its access to the funds. Release Calendar Alpha : July 2017 Release link : Deprecated due to refactor for Aragon 0.3 This will be a development version only focusing on smart contracts, iterating between different models for upgradeability, extensibility and security.\u2029 0.5 \u2014 The Architect Release This release will consist of a total refactor, and will focus on adding: Organization-wide identity Entities in organizations will be able to register their own usernames in the organization, and also provide offchain metadata for displaying purposes in the UI. Full upgradeability Organizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if big chunks of functionality are swapped. Totally new permission system Extensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL (Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains. Switch to an exokernel architecture By making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier. Front-end apps API This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality. We will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns. Core apps API The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities. Decentralized package management By creating the Aragon Package Manager , which is a decentralized organization built on Aragon itself, we enable the frontend and smart contracts to be seamlessly upgraded by using any governance mechanism compatible with aragonOS. Human readable transactions Thanks to our work on Radspec , the Aragon interface can show users a human readable description of the actions the users take on the app. Support for templates Templates allow users to bootstrap organizations with the proper permissions to replicate multiple existing models such a startup, a democracy, an open source community... with just a click. Survey app on mainnet The Survey app is an app built on Aragon that enables token holders to signal their support to different proposal. The first one is live on the mainnet now at https://survey.aragon.org . Blockchain projects that have already manifested interest Release Calendar Alpha : April 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : From May 2017 to July 2018 Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 Release link This will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet. After months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the first organizations to be created using Aragon in the mainnet. 0.6 \u2014 The Sweet Release This release will focus on adding: Permissions app This app will allow stakeholders to read and alter permissions on the organization, by using the modular permission system established by aragonOS. Identity component The identity component will replace all Ethereum addresses with easy to understand identity icons and names for user friendliness, and also serve to autocomplete entities while interacting with the app. Stability fixes Fix bugs and possible issues, both for users and also developers using our developer tools to create Aragon apps. Release Calendar Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 0.7 \u2014 The Network Release This release will focus on adding: Basic network-wide governance Which power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on service providers, payouts functionality. App center The App center will allow third party apps to be installed in Aragon in order to enable different organizations to address different needs. Any aragonOS-compatible app will be able to be installed, and recommendations will be given to users. ANT token minting The network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the governance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the minting rate, the price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network. Integrate upgradeability Provide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations. Release Calendar Alpha : November 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : December 2018 Production deploy (mainnet) : January 2019 0.8 \u2014 The Court Release This release will focus on adding: Aragon Jurisdiction Provide a decentralized court, Aragon Jurisdiction, as network service or work with a decentralized court project to make it work with the network. Orgs in the AN respond to ANJ Organizations in the Aragon Network start being under the Aragon Jurisdiction. Constitution proposal First proposal for the basic laws that all organizations will be act under. Release Calendar Alpha : Q1 2019 Bug bounty (mainnet) : Q2 2019 Production deploy (mainnet) : Q3 2019\u2029 0.9 \u2014 The Unknown Release This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing. Some ideas of what we might work on here: Privacy-focused companies zkSnarks could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are very interesting concepts we are researching about. Different governance mechanisms We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms such as Futarchy . 1.0 \u2014 The Release We expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience.","title":"\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u5212"},{"location":"documentation/Development_Plan/#development-plan","text":"This documentation is currently outdated and will be updated in Q2 2018 version 1.2","title":"Development Plan"},{"location":"documentation/Development_Plan/#introduction","text":"Aragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, associations, open source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain.

ANT is primarily used for the governance of the Aragon Network. After the launch of the Aragon Network, it will also be possible to use ANT to collateralize agreements made by members of the Aragon Network. More information about the use of ANT in the Aragon Network can be found in the Aragon Network whitepaper . Initial token distribution ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a public token sale that took place on May 17, 2017 - starting at Ethereum block 3,723,000 to be exact.

Sources: Etherscan Pre-sale script Technical details ANT is an ERC-20 token using the MiniMe standard . As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo wrote on the Aragon blog: We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The MiniMe Token is an ERC20 token created by the Giveth team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there). In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, we\u2019re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.

Version 1.0 of the Aragon Manifesto was originally published on the Aragon Project blog here . A pledge to fight for freedom We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation. We will either see technology lead to a more free, open, and fair society or reinforce a global regime of centralized control, surveillance, and oppression. Our fear is that without a global, conscious, and concerted effort, the outlook is incredibly bleak. The Internet has opened the doors for universal, cross-border, and non-violent collaborative effort to fight for our freedom . However, the Internet has also opened the doors for global surveillance and manipulation. We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another. Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies. Decentralized technologies provide users unparalleled power to transact and interact with a level of security never seen before. Thanks to cryptography and economic incentives, users can now own truly sovereign assets, create fully sovereign entities, and build truly sovereign identities. They solidify freedoms that cannot be taken away, not even by actors with sizeable resources. This tectonic shift requires a new method for organizing these sovereign individuals: decentralized organizations. For the first time in history, thanks to blockchain technology and smart contracts, we can now create fully decentralized organizations, which are truly autonomous and unstoppable. Decentralized organizations change our relationship with governance : from something that is imposed upon us by others, into something we choose to opt into. Where we are equally serving and served, rather than just serving. Building tools to create and manage decentralized organizations will unleash a Cambrian explosion of new governance forms, and the competition among them will raise the bar globally. It will finally allow us to experiment with governance at the speed of software. Instead of complaining about how badly incentives are set in the world and how poorly resources are allocated, we will have the power to create systems that better align incentives and distribute resources. This is the Enlightenment of the century. Sovereign individuals will be able to freely express themselves and transact with each other without any kind of intermediary exercising their unjustified power and oppressing them. This may be one of the most important revolutions humanity has ever faced. We need to be careful about how we go about it. Technology can be a double-edged sword. We need to explicitly set out the values that Aragon stands for , in order for our community to always uphold and defend them . We are committed to building organizational forms that defend self-sovereignty\u200a\u2014\u200awhere a user can always exercise choice, either by participating or exiting. In today's world, our governing power over society's common goods is negligible. Even for exercising small changes over your environment (your city, state or corporation), you might have to go through cumbersome and opaque bureaucratic processes. This happens because the coordination costs were high in the old world. But now, thanks to the Internet and decentralized governance, we can, and must, engineer systems to empower the people's voice to their fullest potential. Also, if you dislike those broken governance processes, you cannot easily exit from them . Some organizations own your identity (governments), some others own your data (Facebook), and some others even own the path for you to exit (borders), restricting your choice of leaving. We must build organizational structures that allow users to exit with minimal friction if they fundamentally disagree with the governance of those structures. We are committed to creating collaboration mechanisms in which violence is not only disincentivized, but impossible. Choices can only be made freely in the absence of coercion and extortion. Systems should never use violence as a means to incentivize or disincentivize human behavior. With cryptonetworks, we can create environments where others cannot even tell where individuals are located or what they look like. We must make violence in these cryptonetworks impossible by protecting users' privacy with cryptography. We are committed to decentralizing power in order to dismantle unjustified power\u200a\u2014\u200awhich usually springs from centralization. Power has a natural tendency to reinforce itself and become corrupt. If power becomes centralized, it doesn't have to answer to anyone but itself. Decentralizing power is essential to minimizing corruption over time. We must strive to create systems in which a large number of diverse stakeholders have a say, in order for common goods to be responsibly governed by their communities. We are committed to the creation of long-term value versus short-term profit\u200a\u2014\u200awhich in turn, advances sustainability. We want these values to last. We are in this for the long run. In order to make lasting impact and disrupt existing power structures, we must create systems that provide sustainable economic value to their participants. We must honor and encourage the communities that sustain Aragon itself, and we must do so by rewarding those who defend the values outlined in this manifesto. We are committed to a world in which every person can participate in these new organizational structures. We seek to use technology to lift people from oppression. To be successful, we must keep our products open, understandable, and easy to use for everyone. Aragon Association Pledge The Aragon Association is a non-profit entity that safeguards the values of the project. Specifically, the Aragon Association pledges to support the Aragon Manifesto by: Building free, libre, open source technology to allow the creation and management of decentralized organizations Experimenting with new governance models that comply with the Manifesto's values Creating a cryptonetwork for decentralized organizations to thrive (the Aragon Network ) Building a community that defends the Manifesto's values Using the token sale proceeds to fund teams that uphold and defend these values, in order for them to carry and accomplish all the aforementioned tasks Working alongside other entities that pledge to support decentralized technologies and build the underlying infrastructure needed for decentralized organizations to flourish Use all of its assets, including proceeds from the token sale, intellectual property, and brand to maintain, spread and defend the above values We consider this Manifesto an alpha , and look forward to the community's feedback to evolve it over time to a definitive version.
